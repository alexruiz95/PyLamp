 Python code to solve the conservation of energy, momentum and mass            
 for incompressible viscous flow. Some feature include:

 – finite differences
 – implicit (scipy direct solver), fully-staggered grid
 – marker-in-cell for material and temperature advection                       
 – linear (Newtonian) viscosity                                                
 – temperature dependent viscosity and density (buoyancy)

 Code is designed for 2D/3D but currently mostly only 2D features are
 implemented. Designed for rectilinear grid, although some implementations
 (e.g. tracer interpolation) currently rely on using a regular grid.


 Most of the implementations follow methods described in "Introduction
 to Numerical Geodynamic Modelling" by Taras Gerya (ISBN 978-0-521-99754-0).
